# Installing Warp

---

## What It Is

Warp is a modern, AI-powered terminal application built for developers that enhances the command-line experience with features like autocomplete, command suggestions, and a more intuitive interface. While not required for Claude Code, Warp provides a superior terminal experience compared to traditional terminals, especially when working with AI tools like Claude Code, offering better visibility, session management, and workflow organization.

## Key Concepts

- **Modern Terminal:** A next-generation terminal with GUI-like features while maintaining command-line functionality
- **AI Integration:** Built-in AI assistance for command suggestions and explanations
- **Blocks:** Command outputs are organized into collapsible blocks for better readability
- **Workflows:** Saved command sequences that can be reused across projects
- **Team Collaboration:** Share terminal sessions and workflows with team members

---

## Commands & Syntax
```bash
# After installation, launch Warp
warp

# No special installation commands - Warp uses standard terminal commands
# All previous terminal commands (cd, ls, mkdir, etc.) work the same in Warp

# Warp-specific features are accessed through GUI elements, not commands
```

## When to Use

Use Warp as your primary terminal when working with Claude Code if you want an enhanced command-line experience with better visual organization, AI-powered assistance, and modern features that make terminal work more efficient and less error-prone.

## How It Works

**Step 1:** Download Warp from warp.dev for Windows (currently available for macOS, Windows, and Linux)

**Step 2:** Run the installer and follow the installation wizard

**Step 3:** Launch Warp - it will guide you through initial setup and configuration

**Step 4:** Sign in with your account (optional but enables cloud features and syncing)

**Step 5:** Warp automatically detects your existing shell (PowerShell, Git Bash, etc.) and uses it

**Step 6:** Start using Claude Code commands in Warp just as you would in any terminal - no changes needed to your workflow

## Common Issues

### Issue: Warp not available for Windows yet
**Symptoms:** Cannot find Windows version on website  
**Solution:** Check warp.dev for latest availability - if unavailable, use Git Bash or Windows Terminal as alternatives until Windows version releases

### Issue: Warp requires account creation
**Symptoms:** Prompted to sign in during first launch  
**Solution:** Create free account to use Warp - this enables cloud sync and team features, or wait for offline mode if available

### Issue: Commands behave differently in Warp
**Symptoms:** Some commands don't work as expected  
**Solution:** Warp uses your system's default shell - ensure Git Bash or PowerShell is set correctly in Warp settings

## Important Notes

- ⚠️ **Warning:** Warp may not be available for Windows at the time you're learning - check official website for current platform support
- 💡 **Tip:** Warp's autocomplete feature is especially helpful when learning Claude Code commands - it suggests options as you type
- 💡 **Tip:** Use Warp's "blocks" feature to organize Claude Code output - each command response is automatically separated for clarity
- 📌 **Remember:** Warp is optional - you can use Claude Code perfectly fine with Git Bash, PowerShell, or any terminal
- 📌 **Remember:** All standard terminal commands work identically in Warp - it's just a better interface, not a different tool
